# GlowLink Skincare Protocol

A decentralized protocol that provides personalized skincare routine recommendations based on current weather conditions, user skin profiles, and expert-created routines.

## Overview

GlowLink creates trustless, transparent skincare recommendations by combining:
- User skin profiles (type, concerns, goals)
- Real-time weather data (temperature, humidity, UV index)
- Expert-verified skincare routines
- Community feedback and reputation systems

The protocol eliminates marketing bias by using verified dermatologists and maintaining a transparent reputation system based on user feedback.

## Architecture

The protocol consists of several interconnected components:

    A[User Profile Registration] --> B[Core Protocol]
    C[Weather Data] --> B
    D[Expert Verification] --> B
    E[Routine Templates] --> B
    B --> F[Personalized Recommendations]
    F --> G[User Feedback]
    G --> H[Reputation System]
    H --> D
    H --> E
```

### Core Components
- **User Profiles**: Stores skin types, concerns, and skincare goals
- **Expert Verification**: Manages verified dermatologists and skincare experts
- **Routine Templates**: Expert-created skincare routines with weather conditions
- **Recommendation Engine**: Matches users with routines based on profiles and weather
- **Feedback System**: Tracks user ratings and updates expert/routine reputations

## Contract Documentation

### GlowLink Core (`glow-link-core.clar`)

The main contract handling all protocol functionality:

#### Key Features
- User profile management
- Expert verification system
- Routine template creation and management
- Personalized recommendation generation
- Feedback and reputation tracking

#### Access Control
- Contract administrator can verify experts
- Only verified experts can create routine templates
- Users can only submit feedback for their own recommendations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Clarinet
- Stacks wallet for testing

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with Clarinet
3. Deploy contracts to local Clarinet chain

### Basic Usage Example
```clarity
;; Register a user profile
(contract-call? .glow-link-core register-user 
    "oily" 
    (list "acne" "texture") 
    (list "clarifying" "hydration"))

;; Generate a recommendation
(contract-call? .glow-link-core generate-recommendation 
    25 ;; temperature
    60 ;; humidity
    5  ;; UV index)
```

## Function Reference

### User Management
```clarity
(register-user (skin-type (string-ascii 20)) 
               (concerns (list 5 (string-ascii 20))) 
               (goals (list 5 (string-ascii 20))))

(update-user-profile (skin-type (string-ascii 20)) 
                     (concerns (list 5 (string-ascii 20))) 
                     (goals (list 5 (string-ascii 20))))
```

### Expert Functions
```clarity
(verify-expert (expert principal) 
               (credentials (string-utf8 500)))

(submit-routine-template (name (string-utf8 100)) 
                        (description (string-utf8 500)) 
                        ...)
```

### Recommendation System
```clarity
(generate-recommendation (temperature int) 
                        (humidity uint) 
                        (uv-index uint))

(submit-feedback (recommendation-id uint) 
                 (rating uint) 
                 (comments (optional (string-utf8 300))))
```

## Development

### Testing
Run the test suite:
```bash
clarinet test
```

### Local Development
1. Start Clarinet console:
```bash
clarinet console
```

2. Deploy contracts:
```bash
clarinet deploy
```

## Security Considerations

### Limitations
- Weather data should come from a trusted oracle in production
- Recommendation matching algorithm is simplified for demonstration
- Expert verification requires trusted administrator

### Best Practices
- Validate all user inputs
- Use proper error handling
- Implement rate limiting for recommendation generation
- Ensure feedback can only be submitted once per recommendation
- Maintain separate concerns between user profiles and expert verification
